Supported Hardware Devices
--------------------------

KubOS supports a selection of hardware devices in varying capacities.

All supported devices have a :doc:`device API <apis/device-api/index>` which may be used.

Some devices have an additional :doc:`hardware service <services/hardware-services>` which can be built into
KubOS and provides a long-running process which allows easy, streamlined communication with the device.
