Kubos SDK Docs
==============

The "Kubos SDK" is a term used to describe all of the components used
to build Kubos projects:

-  Vagrant box - The VM that contains the "ready to run" Kubos development
   environment
-  Kubos source modules - The underlying libraries on which Kubos projects
   are built
